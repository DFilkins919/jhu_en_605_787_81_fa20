<!--
     General Idea.
     The categories view should list all available categories of items on the 
     menu. Each listing should be a link. Clicking that link should take the 
     user to the /items view. Note that since what the items view state shows is 
     dependent on which category the user clicked, the URL mapping will need to 
     have a parameter in it. I.e., don't take the URLs I am listing in the 
     assignment description as literal URLs. They are just naming hints.

<h3>Categories View</h3>

<ul>
    <li ng-repeat="item in categoriesList.items">
        <a ui-sref="items({shortName:item.short_name})">
            {{ item.name }}
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

<button ui-sref="home">Return to Home Page</button>
