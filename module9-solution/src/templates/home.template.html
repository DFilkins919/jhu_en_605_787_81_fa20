<!--
     General Idea.
     When the user goes to / path in your application, a home screen should be 
     shown. It's up to you what you place on the home screen. You can just say 
     "Welcome to our Restaurant". The home screen should have a link to a list 
     of categories of menu items in the restaurant. Clicking that link would 
     obviously take the user to the /categories view.

<h3>Home View</h3>

<button ui-sref="categories">View Menu Categories</button>
